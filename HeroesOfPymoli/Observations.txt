Much of the results from the data can be summed up into three observations: 

1) Younger people, between the ages 15-24, seem to be the biggest customers. If you narrow this further, 
those that are between 20-24, take up a bit over a third of all total unique sales count from this data. 

2) Even though Males take up 84% of all sales, along with the highest Total Purchase Value, they have the 
lowest Average Purchase Price ($3.02) and Average Total Purchase Per Person ($4.07) compared to Females and Other/Non-Disclosed. 
 
3) Item "Final Critic" seems like the most popular product. Based on this, one would think to 
market this product heavily to Males that are between 20-24 since they seems to be the biggest purchasers by volume. 
However, based on the information above, you would have to be careful since the "Final Critic" sales price is higher than the 
average price this group likes to purchase from.
